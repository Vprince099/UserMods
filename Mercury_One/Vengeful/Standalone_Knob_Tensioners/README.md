# Mod Title: Standalone Knob Tensioners

This mod is desinged to provide a simple and sturdy solution for tensioning belts on the Ender 5 Plus(Need confirmation for the Ender 5) Mercury 1 and Mercury 1.1 Systems

## Description

This Mod is derived from the enclosure project I am currently working on (Jan-2023). In order to provide a version that can be used by the entire Mercury community. I have forked the design and will upload the enclosure version once I am done. This inspired by the Voron V0. This provides a sturdy solution for tensioning your belt while maintaing a design that allows clearance for an enclosure.

## Help

* Due to the tight clearances, I recommend this part to be printed on a properly calibrated printer
* I DO NOT recommend scaling the parts via a slicer as you may have issues with fitment
* Please reach out to me directly on discord if you have any issues or sugestions for this Mod
